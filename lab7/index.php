            <h2>What is Deforestation?</h2>
            <p>Forests cover 30% of our earth's land. <strong>Deforestation</strong> is the purposeful destruction of
                these
                forests for human use. This
                can be done by chopping or burning down large plots of land. Deforestation is often used to make space
                for
                animals, agriculture, or new construction. People also deforest to gather wood for fuel or building
                materials.
                As a result, we lose around 80,000 acres of tropical rainforest every single day (<em>approximately 27
                    football fields per minute</em>).</p>

                <h4>The Slash and Burn Method</h4>
                <p>As we know by now, deforestation is occuring every day on our earth as a result of construction,
                agriculture,
                and other human activity.
                One type of deforestation, used for agriculture, is called the slash and burn method, in which farmers
                burn
                plots of forests to clear farmland and fertilize the ground with the ash from the burnt trees. This
                soil,
                however, becomes
                unusable after a few years, so farmers must move to another location and repeat the method.</p>

                <!--P2: about the effects of slash and burn method -->
            <section class = "slashandburn-effects">
                <h4>Effects of the Slash and Burn Method</h4>
                <p>Trees hold carbon dioxide in their wood. When they are burned, this carbon dioxide goes up into the
                atmosphere, resulting in increased levels
                of global warming. With the slash and burn method, large plots of land are burned, used for agriculture,
                then abandoned. The temporary positive effects
                of the slash and burn method worsens deforestation because farmers are forced to leave the land and find
                another plot to clear out every few years. This justs
                adds to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, accelerating global warming to concerning
                levels.</p>

            </section>
            <section class = "other-effects">
                <h4>Other Negative Effects of Deforestation</h4>
                <p>In addition to the unnerving amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, deforestation also contributes
                soil
                erosion and flooding. Trees provide
                nutrients to soil which helps support the growth of other plants in the forest. When farmers can no
                longer
                use their land, they leave behind barren
                and infertile soil, which is more susceptable to flooding and cannot support forest life. Deforestation
                also
                destroys animal habitats, as many animals
                take shelter under trees and canopies. Deforestation also causes drastic temperature changes, which
                makes
                animal's habitats more inhospitable.</p>

                            28%
                            of the earth's oxygen.</li>
