    <meta name="description" content="Around 80,000 acres of tropical rainforest are cut down every day. Deforestation has ridden our planet and is
        killing one of the earth's most helpful and beautiful plants: trees. It is uncertain whether this deforestation will ever end, but we can ease its
        damaging effects by planting more trees.">

                    <p>The Industrial Revolution (<em>1760-1840</em>) led to a rapid increase in deforestation all over the world. From 1700 to 1850, more than 46 million
            acres of trees (half the size of Germany) were destroyed.</p>

                    <p>Rapid population growth and the invention of the rubber tire in 1914 led to a new wave of deforestation, causing tree loss to rise 50%.
                    Trees lost per decade increased to around 74 million acres.</p>

                    After these projects, tree loss rose to more than 296 million acres per decade.</p>

                    <p>Global deforestation reaches its peak: up to 370 million acres of trees lost per decade. Government investments
                    in infrastructure and agriculture encouraged forest destruction.</p>

                    <p>Eventually, countries reach a <strong>forest transition point</strong> where more trees are regrown than lost. Around
                the end of 1990, forests reached their transition points, causing tree loss to decrease to 128 million in 2000.</p>

            <h2>Today and Onward</h2>
            <p>In the past decade, we lost around 116 million acres of trees, and around 14 million acres of forest were able to regrow. 
                    In order to continue this positive turn for the better, we must keep in mind the impact we have on our earth. If we 
                    continue deforestation as we have been, the beautiful Amazon rainforest could be destroyed beyond repair.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in stopping the damaging effects of deforestation, here are a few organizations that work
                    to better the state of our rainforests:
