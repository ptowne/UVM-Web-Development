            <h3>What is The Long Trail?</h3>
                <p>The Long Trail follows the ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont Border to the Canadian Border. On the beautiful trail, you will encounter 
                    ponds, streams, forests, wildlife, and other magnificent views. It is a very popular hiker's destination; each year, hundreds of adventurers come for backpacking, camping, 
                    hiking, and even horsebackriding! Hiking the Long Trail, you are sure to encounter other passionate hikers while still being able to enjoy the solitude of nature. 
                    The trail has been completed in just 5 days, but typically takes a few weeks to complete. At The Long Trail Hiking Camp, we offer hiking and backpacking expeditions that 
                    explore different parts of The Long Trail, as well as a backpacking trip that lets campers complete the entire trail!

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Our mission at The Long Trail Hiking Camp is to teach people of all ages about the wonders of the backcountry of Vermont. At our camp, we take people on expeditions around
                    the Long Trail, either hiking or backpacking, at various times throughout the summer. These trips allow our campers to meet new friends, build communities, see magnificent views, 
                    eat amazing food, and learn about and explore the beautiful Vermont outdoors! For children, we have a fun day camp that allows campers to explore the outdoors and promotes healthy relationships with
                    nature and prepares children to become hiking masters! We want to unite everyone under Mother Nature and create memories that will last a lifetime.
