            <h2>Backpacking Programs</h2>
            <p>Backpacking at The Long Trail Nature Camp is easy and fun! Trips go out all summer at different areas to allow 
                our campers opportunities to peak many mountains on The Long Trail! Our backpacking trips go out this Summer 2022 
            in the months of June, July, and August.</p>

                <p>The Jerusalem Trail near Starksboro, VT explores Mount Ellen in an 8.5 mile out-and-back hike. On this trail, our 
                    campers will reach a peak elevation of 2,500 feet and will be able to summit Mount Ellen! The Jerusalem Trail is popular,
                    so it is likely our group will encounter other hikers along the way! However, we will find solitude in the quiet forests of Mount Ellen and 
                    set up camp by a beautiful creek. Campers will meet at our facility at 8am the first day and will venture out to the trail shortly after! </p>

                <p>An opportunity to explore the tallest mountain in Vermont awaits! Mount Mansfield reaches an elevation of 4,395 feet, and contains the Haselton Loop, a challenging trail that spans around 7 miles. Our groups start at Barnes Camp and cross the Smuggler's Notch Boardwalk, leading into 
                    The Long Trail. The loop trail has many camp sites for our campers to set up their tents, as well as lodges where we will stop for quick meals along the way! Be careful not to trample the beautiful and striking plants along the way! Our campers will meet at our facility at Barnes Camp 
                    at 9am on the first day where they will prepare for the trip and meet their fellow hikers! Each group has one trip leader and consists of around 15 campers.</p>

                <p>This 2 mile hike explores the small Mount Olga and takes you to the summit where you will see beautiful 
                    views of Southern Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Though challenging, the trail only takes about
                     an hour to complete, making it the perfect hike to complete at any time of day! When we summit, we
                     will enjoy lunch while staring at the amazing views.</p>

            <p>We also offer a children's nature camp that teaches campers about the outdoors and prepares them for hiking. At the day camp, our trip leaders teach
                important backpacking concepts like Leave-No-Trace, setting up tents, and even hanging bear bags! We want to prepare kids to become 
                avid and passionate hikers and to have positive relationships with Mother Nature. We have four sections throughout the summer that run from Monday 
                to Firday so you can't miss it!
